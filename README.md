Hi Dominik,

Thanks for offering to take a look at my task. 

I intend on using this readme to do a quick orientation for you on what I have done here. 

The stack used here is: Next.js, Styled Components, Context API and the https://rickandmortyapi.com API as its one of my favourite cartoons.

The time taken for this task is 4 hours as Anna asked me to. But I am writing this outside the 4 hours.

I have modularised the code, maybe more thna I should have, but I find that doing so helps me imagine all the components coming together like blocks. 

I have written comments wherever I thought you might need an explanation on why I wrote certain code the way I wrote it, but if you think that there were areas that I could have completed in a more cleaner manner, please do let me know. 

Looking forward to recieving your feedback. 

Cheers,
Kisho.
